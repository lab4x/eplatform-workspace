# -------GENERAL SECTION ---------
# syncflux could work in several ways, 
# not all General config parameters works on all modes.
#  modes
#  "hamonitor" => enables syncflux as a daemon to sync 
#                2 Influx 1.X OSS db and sync data between them
#                when needed (does active monitoring )
#  "copy" => executes syncflux as a new process to copy data 
#            between master and slave databases
#  "replicashema" => executes syncflux as a new process to create 
#             the database/s and all its related retention policies 
#  "fullcopy" => does database/rp replication and after does a data copy

[General]
 # ------------------------
 # logdir ( only valid on hamonitor action) 
 #  the directory where to place logs 
 #  will place the main log "
 #  

 logdir = "./log"

 # ------------------------
 # loglevel ( valid for all actions ) 
 #  set the log level , valid values are:
 #  fatal,error,warn,info,debug,trace

 loglevel = "debug"

 # -----------------------------
 # sync-mode (only valid on hamonitor action)
 #  NOTE: rigth now only  "onlyslave" (one way sync ) is valied
 #  (planned sync in two ways in the future)

 sync-mode = "onlyslave"

 # ---------------------------
 # master-db choose one of the configured InfluxDB as a SlaveDB
 # this parameter will be override by the command line -master parameter
 
 master-db = "master"

 # ---------------------------
 # slave-db choose one of the configured InfluxDB as a SlaveDB
 # this parameter will be override by the command line -slave parameter
 
 slave-db = "slave"

 # ------------------------------
 # check-interval
 # the inteval for health cheking for both master and slave databases
 
 check-interval = "10s"

 # ------------------------------
 # min-sync-interval
 # the inteval in which HA monitor will check both are ok and change
 # the state of the cluster if not, making all needed recovery actions

 min-sync-interval = "20s"
 
 # ---------------------------------------------
 # initial-replication
 # tells syncflux if needed some type of replication 
 # on slave database from master database on initialize 
 # (only valid on hamonitor action)
 #
 # none:  no replication
 # schema: database and retention policies will be recreated on the slave database
 # data: data for all retention policies will be replicated 
 #      be carefull: this full data copy could take hours,days.
 # both:  will replicate first the schema and them the full data 

 initial-replication = "both"

 # 
 # monitor-retry-durtion 
 #
 # syncflux only can begin work when master and slave database are both up, 
 # if some of them is down syncflux will retry infinitely each monitor-retry-duration to work.
 monitor-retry-interval = "1m"

 # 
 # data-chuck-duration
 #
 # duration for each small, read  from master -> write to slave, chuck of data
 # smaller chunks of data will use less memory on the syncflux process
 # and also less resources on both master and slave databases
 # greater chunks of data will improve sync speed 

 data-chuck-duration = "60m"

 # 
 #  max-retention-interval
 #
 # for infinite ( or bigger ) retention policies full replication should begin somewhere in the time
 # this parameter set the max retention.
